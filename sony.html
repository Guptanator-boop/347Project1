      <p>People who have ever owned a PlayStation have a very positive association with its classic start-up sound. In fact, the three bestselling gaming consoles of all time are all PlayStations. Surprisingly enough, it was not even Sony who got Sony into producing video games. It was Nintendo.</p>
      <p>Sony and Nintendo originally worked together to develop the Super Disc in 1988. At the time, Nintendo was king, and Sony had not even stepped into the market. The Super Disc was going to be a CD-ROM attachment to be compatible with a new video game Nintendo was releasing. Midway through production, Sony and Nintendo parted ways and despite Nintendos best efforts to salvage production with Phillips, the Super Disc was never introduced to the public. In 1991 Sony introduced a modified Super Disc as part of their first console, the original PlayStation. However only 200 models of the first PlayStation were actually made by Sony.</p>

      <p>After spinning off into multiple business entities over a couple years, the PlayStation division ended up creating Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc in 1993. This is where they switched to CD-ROM, where it was cheaper and more efficient than the cartridges produced by Nintendo. In 1994, the PlayStation X was released and ditched the Nintendo cartridges altogether. It sold over 300,000 units in the first month in Japan. After being introduced to the United States in 1995, they had over 100,000 preorders. They reached the 100 million sold mark by 2003, marking the beginning of what continues to be one of the most successful video game divisions of all time.</p>
