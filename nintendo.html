      <p>Nintendo started with humble beginnings as a card company. They produced Hanafuda cards when the Japanese Government was cracking down on card gambling. In 1972, the U.S. military test project the Brown Box became available to the public as the first home video game console called the Magnavox Odyssey. Nintendo made their first foray into the world of video games in 1975 by acquiring the Odyssey's distribution rights for Japan. After the success of the Odyssey, Nintendo started developing its own games and consoles with the Color TV-Game systems. It included the original version of Pong, a legendary game to this day.</p>

      <p>As the years went on, Nintendo continued to see success with their consoles and games in every region except for Russia and the US. Nintendo wanted to get into the US market, but Atari flooded the market with poor quality games, giving the whole industry a bad reputation. To prevent bad games, Nintendo developed the 10NES lockout chip that prevented unlicensed games from working on the system, the beginning of the long debate between indie developers and large video game companies. In 1989, Nintendo released the most important portable gaming system, the Gameboy. It introduced generation defining games like Tetris. As time went on, Nintendo developed legendary characters like Mario that we still see coming out today. Nintendo was the first to include an analog thumb stick in their controllers and have been a pioneer for gaming and will continue to be so.</p>
