      <p>In 2001, the original Xbox was released. In November 2020, the new Xbox Series X will be released. What started as a simple project has evolved to be a multibillion-dollar section of Microsoft, accounting for a little less than 10% of Microsofts total revenue.</p>

      <p>Codenamed the DirectX Box, the intended purpose of the Xbox was to be a gaming system built like a PC to bring flexibility and power to the home console market. It would run on Windows 2000 and had twice the processing power of the PlayStation 2, which had the biggest share of the home console market. Bill Gates and Dwayne Johnson revealed the final Xbox version at 2001 CES. Fun Fact: the Times Square branch of Toys R Us hosted the first official launch. Being low on price at $299, they sold over 1 million Xboxes in the three weeks after the initial launch. It was complemented with a well-received game that defined my video game days personally, Halo. Halo had 1 million copies sold in the first couple of months after release.</p>
      <p>The Xbox 360 was released as the successor of the original Xbox in November 2005, competing with Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles. It sold out almost immediately in all regions. It also expanded their Xbox Live Service and included the revolutionary Kinect technology (which is now depreciated). After multiple interations of the Xbox 360, the Xbox One was the next generation of gaming, including 1080p resolution gaming. The power of the Xbox's processing combined with a solid library of games makes Xbox a true gaming empire to behold.</p>
