      <p>Ever hear of Sonic the Hedgehog? Well, you have SEGA to thank for him. Sonic is one of the world’s most famous video game characters ever made and was introduced with the launch of the video game Sonic the Hedgehog designed for the Sega Genesis. After the release, he quickly became one of the most influential video game characters of all time.</p>

      <p>If you have ever been to an arcade, odds are you have also played many Sega games. To this day, Sega is one of the worlds most prolific arcade game producers. A full list of their video games is listed <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sega_arcade_video_games”>here</a>. </p>
      <p>Segas consoles had very dramatic ups and downs throguhout its lifespan, with its final console being the Sega Dreamcast. It preceded the PS2, the GameCube and the original Xbox. As soon as those other consoles were released, it spelled the end of all Sega consoles. Sega was unable to deliver the value that the other three were able to. Fun fact, Sega annouced that they would no longer procude consoles in 2001 but produced games for the Dreamcast until 2007. Now that is what I call going out in style and grace.</p>
